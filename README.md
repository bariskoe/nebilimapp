The Nebilim App will be the realization of my personal quiz app which I have been
visualizing for some time before I got into coding. Nebilim is a combination of "ne" and "bileyim", which means "what do I know?" in turkish.

I will apply a clean code architecture with the respective unit tests. The datasource of the questions ist a, Sqlite database at the beginning. If everything works fine and when there are a few thousand questions available,
I will try to code and deploy a suitable backend for it.

Questions are available in German and English and the locale is being set automatically thanks to the localizations and intl package.

The most important features will be:
- Difficult questions can be marked, so that they can get special attention in the future until the user memorizes the answer. This will be possible either by a normal tap on the ui or by a tap on a wireless headphone

- Annoying questions can be sorted out, so that they will not be asked again.

- The app will be able to read questions (Text to speech), so that the user will not have to look at the screen while he is expanding his wisdom. This will be especially useful in overcrowded stinky and sweaty public transport on the way to the office in the morning. This way, the hands and eyes are not occupied and can stay on the userÂ´r purse.

-There will be a speech to text recognition. This means: After a long workday when you just want to close your eyes and sleep, push the play button. The app will read a question and wait for a few seconds until you answer. You will be able to keep your eyes closed and answer by speaking to the app. It will recognize if your answer was correct or not. Then it will continue with the next question.

- There will be a duel mode. Two or more players will be able to play against each other by pressing a buzzer.
